            <p className="mt-2">
              The was a solo project for a UI/UX course with Chris Swain at IYA.
              Gifted was devised after Dalle-2 and MidJourney but before ChatGPT
              or Bing chat made the concept effectively obsolete. But this was a
              fantastic exercise in human-centered design. I expanded my skills
              in user research and testing and learned a lot about the
              importance of storytelling in design. I am proud of the work I did
              on this project and I am excited to share it here.

              In the hustle of Christmas, Kylee, a devoted gift-giver, was in a
              race against time. Scouring every online store and magazine, she
              struggled to find the ideal gift for her cherished Uncle Z within
              her budget. Just when she was close to settling for the ordinary,
              she discovered the Gifted app. Pouring her thoughts into the app,
              detailing Z&apos;s tastes and her earlier gift ideas, she was
              presented with a stunning revelationâ€”a classical pocket watch.
              From Amazon to artisanal options, she had a gamut to pick from.
              Thanks to Gifted&apos;s smart filters, she zeroed in on a unique
              watch from a niche store, had it exquisitely engraved, and placed
              it wrapped under the tree, well in time for the festive morning.

              I grew my Figma and design skills by leaps and bounds through this
              project. Professor Swain pushed us to do our most excellent work
              and I really did do my best. I learned a lot about the importance
              of user research and testing. I also learned a lot about the
              importance of storytelling in design. I am proud of the work I did
              on this project, even if the idea is kaput.
